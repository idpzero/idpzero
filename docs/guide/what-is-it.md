# What is idpzero?

The goal of <span class="idpzero-text">idpzero</span> is to enable developers to implement best practice security and authentication in projects as early as possible. Typically hosting and configuring an identity provider is complexity and time consuming; it's simpler to ignore authentication. We've all been there!

**<span class="idpzero-text">idpzero</span> is different** - it's a single binary IdP that is designed to complement the local dev/test experience - not fight with it!

By making the hosting of an OpenID Connect / OAuth2 compliant IDP as simple as `idpzero serve` the complexity has been taken away, replaced by a simple and all round *delightful* experience for local development.
