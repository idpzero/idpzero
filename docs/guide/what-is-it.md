# What is idpzero?

The goal of `idpzero` is to enable developers to implement best practice security and authentication as early as possible. Typically hosting and configuring an identity provider can be a complexity and time consuming; we've all been there, it's simpler to ignore up front!

**idpzero is different**. 

It's a single binary identity provider that plays nicely with the local dev/test experience, and designed to have its configuration safely stored in source control. 

By making the hosting of an OpenID Connect / OAuth2 compliant IDP as simple as `idpzero serve` the complexity has been taken away, replaced by a simple and all round *delightful* experience for local development.
